  <div class="item-c"><h2>sylvarant</h2>
    <p class="left">
    Sylvarant has been the declining world for a long period of time. While there are many villages and small towns that populate the planet, they are not very grand or technologically advanced. As a result, the towns are all self-governed with no overarching governmental structure. There are also small ‘Houses of Salvation’ along pilgrimage paths that offer the teachings of the Goddess Martel. There are numerous ‘human ranches’ that populate Sylvarant, run by half-elves who operate under the Desian Grand Cardinals. These facilities use human labor to manufacture gems called Exspheres. Every town with a human ranch nearby deals with it differently - Iselia has a peace treaty with them so that they don’t terrorize their village, while Palmacosta has a military force and takes an active stance against them. To save Sylvarant before it slips even further down the path to destruction, the Chosen of Mana must go on a journey of World Regeneration: this consists of a pilgrimage to the seals of Fire, Water, Air and Light before ending their journey at the Tower of Salvation with the intent of becoming an angel.

  <div class="item-d"><h3>tethe'alla</h3>
    <p class="right">
Tethe’alla has been the prosperous world for a long period of time. While the planet is still lush with nature and various ecosystems, there are notably larger cities that all operate under a monarchy, aside from the hidden village of the elves. The King of Tethe’alla resides in Meltokio, as well as the Pope of the Church of Martel and the Chosen One of Tethe’alla. However, this Chosen does not need to undertake a journey and mainly reaps the benefits of their status. If Tethe'alla were in decline, however, the elemental seals found on the planet are Ice, Earth, Lightning and Darkness. Research on the world and new technology is mainly conducted at the Sybak Research Academy. There are multiple kinds of technological advancements, one of which is the Grand Tethe’alla Bridge that connects two of the continents together as a drawbridge operated by Exspheres. There are seemingly no Desians operating in Tethe’alla. However, the King and a select few are aware of the existence of the other world of Sylvarant due to intel from a secret organization, and are intent on stopping the process of world regeneration by any means - sending an assassin across a seemingly uncrossable dimensional barrier to Sylvarant…

    More than four thousand years ago, Sylvarant and Tethe’alla were once two warring countries on a planet named Aselia. Mithos Yggdrasill, accompanied by his sister Martel and his allies Kratos Aurion and Yuan Ka-Fai, decided that the only way to stop any more bloodshed was to split the countries into two worlds. At the time, the world’s energy source, mana, was provided by the Great Tree. However, Martel was killed in the crossfire of the war by humans, turning Mithos bitter towards humanity. In a desperate bid to save his sister, he bound her soul to the seed of the Great Tree. Using the pacts he formed with the elemental spirits found at each seal, he formed a cage of protection around the Great Seed, balancing it between both worlds. To preserve enough mana within the seed to keep his sister’s soul alive, he formed the organization called Cruxis, as well as implemented the system of a constantly cycling prosperous and declining world. This would also serve to stop any more meaningless wars with advanced technology.

  <div class="item-j">
    <p class="right">
      As a result, the two worlds function under what could essentially be equated to an hourglass system. The limited mana from the Great Seed pours from the declining world into the prosperous world until the Chosen completes the Journey of Regeneration, flipping the hourglass. To keep this system in check, Cruxis serves to watch over the worlds, enforcing the teachings of the false religion that paints Martel as a Goddess who will eventually wake again. This is achieved through the Church of Martel found in both worlds. Mithos, Kratos and Yuan are three of the Four Seraphim (Martel being the symbolic fourth) that govern Cruxis, with Mithos as their leader. In addition, the Desians are also an organization formed by Mithos to cause havoc upon the declining world. Even the Chosen lineage is a manipulated variable: Mithos hopes that eventually, one Chosen will have a close enough mana signature to his sisters’ to bring her back to life in their body.

  <div class="item-l">
    <h3>cruxis</h3>
    <p class="right">
      Cruxis, the organization created by Mithos Yggdrasill, is composed of angels. Under the supervision of the Seraphim, there are High Angels who are in charge of material storage, guarding entrances to their base of operations located in Welgaia, among other things. The rest of the angels that inhabit Welgaia seem almost robotic or lifeless. One of those angels, however, is tasked with acting as the Chosen’s angelic father and guide throughout the seals, granting angelic power to the Chosen each time they progress in their pilgrimage. Angels see themselves as above the rest of humanity. In reality, they are half-elves wearing Cruxis Crystals - an evolved form of exsphere - which grants them their angelic power and status.
      <p>
  </div>
  <div class="item-m">
    <h2>desians</h2>
    <p class="left">
      The Desians are another branch of Cruxis. Each human ranch is overseen by a Desian Grand Cardinal, who ensures that the manufacture of exspheres is going as intended. Notably, while the Desians are aware of Cruxis, they aren’t aware of who exactly the Seraphim are and what their main goals are. They report to the leader of the Desian Grand Cardinals, who reports to Mithos Yggdrasill. Other than production of exspheres, the Desians act as a threat to the Chosen on their journey of regeneration. While this may seem counter-intuitive, the adrenaline and sense of danger actually awaken the Chosen’s angelic powers at a faster rate. This is because the Chosen are gifted a Cruxis Crystal at the start of their journey, which works to evolve them into an angel.

  <div class="item-p">
    <h3>renegades</h3>
    <p class="right">
      The Renegades look nearly identical to Desians, but are an active rebel organization that seek to undermine Cruxis and the Desians. They are led by Yuan Ka-Fai, one of Mithos’ old companions and one of the Four Seraphim. Mithos is unaware of the operations of the Renegades. Yuan, who was engaged to Martel, wants to honor her dying wishes to make the world a better place. As a result, the Renegades work covertly under the disguise of Desians to enact their plans of breaking the cage of protection around the Great Seed and allowing it to sprout. To do this, the Renegades leaked information of the nature of the two worlds to the King of Tethe’alla, causing them to send an assassin to Sylvarant with the intent of killing the Chosen.
